# Portfolio-SQL

This project focused on using SQL to analyze the data of a fictional movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth) in order to help them successfully launch their own streaming service. Of special importance were the following questions:

* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?       
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?     
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?     
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?     
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The final spreadsheet and data dictionary contain most of the completed work, but examples of specific skills are displayed in their own files.
