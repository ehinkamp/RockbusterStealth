SQL queries for CareerFoundry project

This project focused on using SQL to analyze the data of a fictional movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth) in order to help them successfully launch their own streaming service. Of special importance were the following questions:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?       
What was the average rental duration for all videos?     
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?     
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?     
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
