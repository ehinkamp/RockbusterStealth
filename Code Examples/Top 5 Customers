This project had a curious definition of what constitutes the "top 5 customers." Rather than the five customers who spent the most money, the exercises led me to first find the 10 countries with the most customers, then the 10 cities within those countries with the most customers, then the highest spenders of the customers within those cities. As the purpose of these exercises is to get more comfortable with using SQL, I went along with it.

Top 10 countries:

SELECT D.country, COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

Top 10 cities within countries:

SELECT C.city, D.country, COUNT (customer_id)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

Top 10 customers within cities:

SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5
