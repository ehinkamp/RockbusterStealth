The following queries involved the use of subqueries to find information about the top 5 customers.

This project had a curious definition of what constituted the "top 5 customers." Rather than the five customers who spent the most money, the exercises led me to first find the 10 countries with the most customers, then the 10 cities within those countries with the most customers, then the highest spenders of the customers within those cities. As the purpose of these exercises was to get more comfortable with using SQL, I went along with it.

Average amount paid by top 5 customers:

SELECT total_amount_paid.first_name, total_amount_paid.last_name, total_amount_paid.avg_paid
FROM (SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(amount) AS total_paid, AVG(amount) AS avg_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
GROUP BY total_amount_paid.first_name, total_amount_paid.last_name, total_amount_paid.avg_paid
ORDER BY total_amount_paid.avg_paid DESC

How many of top 5 customers are in each country:

SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS call_customer_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(amount) AS total_paid, AVG(amount) AS avg_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers ON D.country=top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
